# Show duplicates v0.4
# Show card duplicates for a card below it.

# Changelog
# 0.4: Disable an overly strict assertion triggering if a card is moved to another deck under certain circumstances.
# 0.3: Don't group together non-text cards.
# 0.2: Update cache when the user adds/modifies/deletes cards.
# 0.1: Initial version.

# TODO
# Update timings on the duplicates.
